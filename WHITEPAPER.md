# CYCLES-TRANSFER-STATION WHITEPAPER

https://cycles-transfer-station.com

The CTS is a 100% on-chain order-book market trade platform for ICRC-1 tokens on the internet-computer.

At the CTS, the market tokens trade against the native CYCLES, a stablecoin on the internet-computer, creating a stable trading scenario where tokens find their value based on their own merits and are not swayed by the price of ICP. 

### What are CYCLES?

For canisters (smart-contracts, blockchain-code) on the internet-computer to live and store data and perform computation, they need to pay CYCLES to the internet-computer platform, which then burns the CYCLES as they are paid.

The CYCLES are stable at 1-XDR (1.3-USD) = 1-TCYCLES (1-TRILLION-CYCLES).

People can mint CYCLES through the NNS using ICP. The NNS has a built-in exchange-rate-oracle to know the current price of ICP relative to XDR, and will mint 1-TCYCLES for every 1-XDR worth of ICP at the time of the mint.

Since people can mint CYCLES through the NNS at the rate of 1-XDR = 1-TCYCLES, the price of CYCLES will never go higher than 1-XDR per 1-TCYCLES.

The stability of the CYCLES is tied to the cycles-burn-rate of the ICP network as a whole which is tied to the success of the ICP network as a whole and the value that the ICP blockchain creates for the world. The more services built on ICP, the more CYCLES get burned. The higher the cycles-burn-rate, the more stable the CYCLES are, because if CYCLES are constantly being burned then the price of CYCLES can never get too low, because if they go low, canister maintainers will buy them up and the price will go back up to it's peg.

Due to this stability mechanism, this makes the CYCLES a great native stablecoin for the world-computer which is tied to the success of the world-computer itself.

### The value of the CYCLES-TRANSFER-STATION

The CTS market lets people trade many ICRC-1 tokens for CYCLES backward and forward without having to go through the ICP token. This creates many benefits for every party. For canister authors and maintainers, it gives them a chance to purchase CYCLES to power their canisters using many different tokens that they may have such as their native token if it is an SNS, or other tokens they may have without dipping into their ICP treasury. So far, the OpenChat SNS and the KINIC SNS have integrated with the CTS and now their autonomous governance canisters have placed orders at the CTS market trading their native tokens CHAT and KINIC for CYCLES to fuel their dapp canisters. For mainstream users, it gives them a chance to purchase and trade many ICRC-1 tokens using the CYCLES stablecoin without having to purchase ICP, therefore growing the usability of the CYCLES.

This CTS functionality is the foundation of the general mainstream usage of the internet-computer's native CYCLES as a stablecoin. 

Users can go into the CTS website, login, and purchase CYCLES at the market using many ICRC-1 tokens, or users can mint some CYCLES with ICP using the NNS's mint mechanism through the CTS website's user-interface without knowing how to code or use a command-line. Through the user-interface of the website, users can transfer CYCLES between CTS accounts or send CYCLES out of the CTS onto a canister to topup a canister with CYCLES.

The CTS kickstarts the ecosystem of the CYCLES as a stablecoin.

### SNS-LAUNCH

The CTS is launching an SNS (Service-Nervous-System) DAO and creating the CTS token which governs the CTS platform.

The SNS launch of the CTS spreads out the surface-area of the controll of the system so that the CTS fullfills it's goal of being a decentralized public-good for the world. The whole system is verifiable with reproducible builds and available source code, so users can verify on the blockchain what the system is doing when they use it. Every update to the platform must pass through a decentralized vote of the global CTS token holders for an update to take place. 

The CTS market charges a fee for trades made on the platform. People who stake their CTS tokens, and participate in the governance voting, share the profits of the platform in proportion to their stake and voting participation.

Holders of the CTS token are therefore shareholders of the CTS platform, and share in the governance as well as the profits of the system.

Profits of the platform will be sent to every shareholder on a periodic basis (like once a month).

### OUTLOOK-GOING-FORWARD

The CTS team plans on continuing on our journey of building the ecosystem of the CYCLES as a stablecoin.

The general plan going forward is to calibrate the platform for the needs of the ecosystem and it's users as we grow. 

The team's vision for the CTS is that the CTS is the home for the internet-computer's native CYCLES. A station where people go to do everything they need with the CYCLES. As the ecosystem grows, more needs will become clear. For this now, the CYCLES market is the focus.

A couple of things we have planned are: 
 - The implementation of the sharing of the profits of the platform with the CTS token shareholders, 
 - More SNS integrations, 
 - A wonderful custom candlestick chart,
 - Different order types such as stop-limit, market, immediate-or-cancel, and all-or-none orders.
 - General website UI touchups,
 - More robust and automatic backup and rollback feature.

Some of the long-term features we are thinking about are borrowing and lending many tokens using the CYCLES stablecoin as the collateral, and complex escrow services.

### CONCLUSION

Thanks for reading, we value your consideration.

The CTS team takes this pledge to continue on our journey, and manifest the vision of the CYCLES-TRANSFER-STATION.
