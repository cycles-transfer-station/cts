# CYCLES-TRANSFER-STATION WHITEPAPER

https://cycles-transfer-station.com

The CTS is a 100% on-chain order-book market trade platform for ICRC-1 tokens on the internet-computer.

At the CTS, the market tokens trade against the native CYCLES, a stablecoin on the internet-computer, creating a stable trading scenario where tokens find their value based on their own merits and are not swayed by the price of ICP. 

### What are CYCLES?

For canisters (smart-contracts, blockchain-code) on the internet-computer to live and store data and perform computation, they need to pay CYCLES to the internet-computer platform, which then burns the CYCLES as they are paid.

The CYCLES are stable at 1-XDR (1.3-USD) = 1-TCYCLES (1-TRILLION-CYCLES).

People can mint CYCLES through the NNS using ICP. The NNS has a built-in exchange-rate-oracle to know the current price of ICP relative to XDR, and will mint 1-TCYCLES for every 1-XDR worth of ICP at the time of the mint.

Since people can mint CYCLES through the NNS at the rate of 1-XDR = 1-TCYCLES, the price of CYCLES will never go higher than 1-XDR per 1-TCYCLES.

The stability of the CYCLES is tied to the cycles-burn-rate of the ICP network as a whole which is tied to the success of the ICP network as a whole and the value that the ICP blockchain creates for the world. The more services built on ICP, the more CYCLES get burned. The higher the cycles-burn-rate, the more stable the CYCLES are, because if CYCLES are constantly being burned then the price of CYCLES can never get too low, because if they go low, canister maintainers will buy them up and the price will go back up to it's peg.

Due to this stability mechanism, this makes the CYCLES a great native stablecoin for the world-computer which is tied to the success of the world-computer itself.

### The value of the CYCLES-TRANSFER-STATION

The CTS market lets people trade many ICRC-1 tokens for CYCLES backward and forward without having to go through the ICP token. This creates many benefits for every party. For canister authors and maintainers, it gives them a chance to purchase CYCLES to power their canisters using many different tokens that they may have such as their native token if it is an SNS, or other tokens they may have without dipping into their ICP treasury. For mainstream users, it gives them a chance to purchase and trade many ICRC-1 tokens using the CYCLES stablecoin without having to purchase ICP, creating a stable trading scenario.

This CTS functionality is the foundation of the general mainstream usage of the internet-computer's native CYCLES as a stablecoin. 

Users can go into the CTS website, login, and purchase CYCLES at the market using many ICRC-1 tokens, or users can mint some CYCLES using ICP through the NNS's mint mechanism through the CTS website's user-interface without knowing how to code or use a command-line. 

The CTS kickstarts the ecosystem of the CYCLES as a stablecoin.

### TOKENOMICS

The CTS is launching an SNS (Service-Nervous-System) DAO and creating the CTS token which governs the CTS platform.

The CTS market charges a fee for trades made on the platform. People who stake their CTS tokens, and participate in the governance voting, share the profits of the platform in proportion to their stake and voting participation.

Holders of the CTS token are therefore shareholders of the CTS platform, and share in the governance as well as the profits of the system.

Profits of the platform will be sent to every shareholder on a periodic basis (like once a month).
